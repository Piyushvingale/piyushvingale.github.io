									<p>Welcome! I am Currently pursuing MBA in Applied Data Science.</p>

									Hi I am Piyush Ingale, <br />

									My personality can best be defined by a single word, analytical. I enjoy learning about many different subjects, from effective decision-making processes and personality traits of great leaders to developing and productionalizing machine learning algorithms. The central themes in these interests has always been about analyzing data, human behavior, and organizational strategy. <br />

									Outside of work I enjoy playing board games, watching too much netflix, working on data-related projects, and simply spending time in developing softwares. <br />

									These themes can be traced back to my time at university. My first master, Industrial and Organizational Psychology, was a great opportunity for learning about the role of human behavior in successful organizations. <br />

									However, I felt as if there was still so much more for me to learn. Knowing that I decided to look into a different direction in order to further develop myself as a professional, namely pursuing a MBA in Applied Data Science. This master gave me the skills necessary to have a truly deep understanding of data science & management skills. <br />

									Believe it or not, I still had the feeling something important was missing in my educational and professional background. I cannot express how fortunate I am to have found the missing part in the MBA in Data Science. It helped me develop into a person that has recognized its main ability to be analytical, data-driven, and interested in the unique combination of SaaS and AI. <br />

									My greatest achievement is that, I was an Univeristy ranker in my BCA in Science. However, Iâ€™ll make sure to never stop learning. <br />

									Having seen and experienced with one organization, from Kothurd, Pune. I believe that in many cases a deep understanding of human behavior is necessary to problem's solution to the next level. Not only when developing the solution, but also to understand the needs of stakeholders, clients and most importantly, customers and end-users. <br />

									Perhaps it is not the most common road to Data Science, but it is one that I truly enjoyed and would not have traded for anything else. <br />
